This is a handy tool to help to identify and clean up duplicated files. This is also my first Groovy application, calculating files' MD5 digests to find the duplicates.

Usage:
java -jar duplifind.jar path\_you\_wanna\_scan

WARNING: This program helps you exclude duplicates by DELETING files. Be careful when using this.
